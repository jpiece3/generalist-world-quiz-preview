          <div class="dialogue-text">That makes total sense. One thing I hear a lot from generalists at your stage is that the biggest gap isn't skills or strategy -- it's the peer group. Are you currently connected with other generalists who are operating at your level?</div>

It's 570+ people -- fractional executives, portfolio careerists, founders -- who are building the kind of career you're describing. There are live workshops, accountability groups, and curated job opportunities that match generalist strengths. Would you like me to tell you more about how it works?</div>

          <div class="dialogue-text">If you're curious about exploring this more, I'd suggest two things. First, the weekly newsletter -- it's free and it's packed with career frameworks for people with your wiring. And second, the Archetype Quiz -- it tells you what KIND of generalist you are. It pairs really well with the Career Blocker results you already have.</div>
        </div>

      <div class="tip-box">The best outcome for a cold lead conversation is that they subscribe to the newsletter and take the Archetype Quiz. That's a win. Do not push further.</div>
